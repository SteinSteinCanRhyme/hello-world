# hello-world

I want learn everything I can on coding because it looks fun. Plain and simple. So please excuse any simple questions or inquiries, this is learning process for me in something I know almost nothing about. Have a good one. :)

Well, I enjoy hiking and running in my spare time and help train dogs in my spare time.
